# BandSense

**Research Problem/Space:**

Bandaid sensors, or sensors that have been implemented on bandaids, provide close proximity to the skin and enable measurements of subtle movements, skin temperature, perspiration and other physiological characteristics. Fabricating these sensors, however, are often time consuming and expensive. We designed bandaid sensors that are capable to measuring motions (flexion and extension) using off-the-shelf materials - specifically, our sensors leverage how the resistance of conductive thread changes when it is pulled taut or let loose, and implements the thread in the bandage to observe how the resistance changes for different motions.

**Research Questions:**

Prequel: Understand raw data; record sessions, understand the pipeline for data storing.

1) How can we extract features from raw sensor data?
- Data exploration; data visualization; data processing
- Feature extraction
  
2) What kinds of features can be extracted from raw sensor data for use in machine learning algorithms?
